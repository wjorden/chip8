# Chip8 Emulator

## Why?

Chip8 emulators are a good introduction into emulation. Most people start with 
this as there emulator intro. I'm, now, part of that statistic. It's been fun,
so far (this has been an ongoing project). 

For me, I'm using this as a base to gain understanding of handling embedded
systems and how their opcodes work so that I can write an ABI for another
project. 

## Languages

Right now, It is solely in C, with plans to do this in other langauges.
