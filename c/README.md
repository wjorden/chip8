# CHIP8 Emulator

I'm a huge gaming fan and always wanted to make my own games. I also wanted a
better understanding of what is occuring behind the scenes. I'm using this
project as a multi-faceted learning objective. 

## Objective (and some anecdotes)

When I was younger, I spent a lot of time playing video games. SEGA, NES, SNES,
even arcades were a dream come true. Now that video games have become a mainstay
in the homes of everyone (console, PC, Web), I wanted to know how they work at a
low level. This project is my deep dive into the inner workings of libraries
like SDL, RayLib, and others. 

## Planning The Program

For the most part, I'm following a [tutorial](https://github.com/queso-fuego/chip8_emulator_c) that has videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT7NbkyNWaqbyBMzdySdqjnfUFxt8rnU_). The layout and structure is pretty
close to that. It will be customized more in the future.  

The chip8 programs come from [kripod](https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms). As
they're being used, they are being moved to this directory under a shorter name.
Currently, the IBM logo is printing, however I'm not sure there are supposed to
be blank lines in the logo.
